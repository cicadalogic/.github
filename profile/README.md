# CicadaLogic

Cicada Logic is a cybersecurity company founded in 2006 by a group of three good friends.

The company have shifted focus more towards cybersecurity around 2009, after producing the first know ZeroData passwordless login system.
Up to this day, no known company actually implement a no data passwordless system.

The company have split after 2011, as the complexity of cybersecurity increases, two of the member decided to put more focus on software development, rather than security.

Years later, this turns out to be invaluable for the success of the company, as security and developing, must go together, and one can and must support the other.

Many companies do not have problem in security in which they care, they have problems in management, development, knowledge of the tools used, marketing and such.

When you can support a business in those areas, while also providing security, the result is a more natural and linear progression, without taking out critical resources the business need.

## Cicada 3301

Lucas has been the first person to have completed the location challenge by living next to two of the codes.

Some rumors said that he was the one who have placed the two codes, since he was living nearby, and he's known for using two aliases and two signature close to each other, hidden somewhere in plain sight, during his time has a hacker.

However, that is not true, also the name has been picked a very long time ago, way before Cicada 3301 have born, it just so happen that we have picked the same name in two different internet eras.

It is not uncommon, some people may share the same experiences, even when time and distance separates them, so the same name might have been pick for the same exact meaning, as we like to think, but we will never know.

Hacking is not only a technology driven problem, you have no control over the technology, security and software are made by thinking users are dumb, cannot learn and do not actually evolve.

We want to give you the same superpowers that we have as hackers.

We do trust other humans, we do believe you can learn and evolve, we are not afraid you can become closer to us.

The blockchain show us the public is not ready to take full control over the technology, do you want to be a generic individual?  We don't think so.
